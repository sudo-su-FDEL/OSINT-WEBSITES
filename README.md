# OSINT-WEBSITES
A small program with websited and tools that I believe are efficient for OSINT research.




# Features
Decided to make this tool for osint reseachers or anyone who is interested in OSINT. The main idea behing this tool is to save time searching for websites on google 
and instead bring them up by pressing keys.

Program contains website that are beneficial in obataining basic information on adversaries. 

For extensive searching please refer to the "Misc" option in the program.

# Set Up
Upon starting this program, you will automatically be launched to a website which will provide you a temporary email that expires after 10 minutes, there is an option to reset the time if you need more time with it.

# People Search
Search for adversaies using reliable websites: whitepages and fastpeoplesearch


# Email information 
This website highly complements OSINT research on Gmail but you are able to obtain some information with other domains (i.e hotmail, yahoo,etc...)

# Phone Numbers 

* WhatsApp ChatWatch: allows you to spy on WhatsApp users and see when they are online. You will need the temporary email to use its services for a span of 8 hours.

* WhatsApp number verification: allows you to check if a phone number is active on WhatsApp

* FastPeopleSearch (Phone Number): Search for information on a phone number.

* Phonerator  Personally my favorite website if you only have part of a phone number, refer to the link in the proram to learn how to use it.


# Reverse Image search

* TineEye
* Yandex
* Google Images
* PimEyes
* LetsEnhance (This is not a reverse image search however, if you are able to obtain a blurry picture, using this tool will "de-blur" it using its AI. Use temporary email to create and account)

# Geolocation
* Dual maps: Have street view, satelite view, and street names view in one screen, just click view map when prompted to main screen.
* YouTube Geolocation: Find YouTube videos taken in certain locations.
* SnapMap: Find Snapchat stories using snapmap

# Social Media 
* Facebook Search find people on FaceBook by searching their name, no spaces in typing the name as your input is added on the a URL link embdedded in the program.
* SocialBearings(Twitter): Type adversaries Twitter profile to gain insights on their profile.
* Tinfoleaks (Twitter): Another option but will give slightly different results.

(Currently only Twitter and Facebook, Instagram has recently updated, needs more research for OSINT opportunites)

# Misc 
* More webistes with different tools
